Important Notes:
----------------
The instructions provided on this file assume you have Python installed and
configured on your operating system.

Currently FFcuesplitter-gui is still under development and no pre-compiled packages
have been distributed, but since it comes with a `setup.py` file, you can build it
and install it very easily into your operating system as a Python wheel.

However, to achieve this a virtual python environment is recommended, for
example using tools like `python3-venv` or `virtualenv`, which once activated,
you can install packages in the virtual environment using pip and then installing
FFcuesplitter-gui into it. At present, other installation methods that use
administrative privileges such as superuser or root are strongly discouraged.

First of all, install the essential packages using the package manager provided
by your linux distribution, then install wxPython version 4.0.7 or higher.
On debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Mint, MXLinux, etc)
this package is identified as `python3-wxgtk4.0` .
Aldo make sure you have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` already installed.

Activate your virtual Python directory:
$ source 'path_to_environment_directory/bin/activate'

To install FFcuesplitter-gui, open a terminal window and type:
$ python3 -m pip install https://github.com/jeanslack/FFcuesplitter-GUI/tarball/main

To run the program type:
$ ffcuesplitter-gui

-------
Windows
-------

Activate your virtual Python directory:
.\path_to_environment_directory\Scripts\activate

To install FFcuesplitter-gui type:
python -m pip install https://github.com/jeanslack/FFcuesplitter-GUI/tarball/main

Make sure you have ffmpeg and ffprobe available somewhere on your system, as
these dependencies are not provided automatically by FFcuesplitter-gui.

Once you have ffmpeg and ffprobe, start FFcuesplitter-gui (just type ffcuesplitter-gui
in your command prompt window), click the Setup button, go to the FFmpeg tab and
provide the location on your file system.
